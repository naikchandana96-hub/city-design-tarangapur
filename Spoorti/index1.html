  <h2>1. Smart Fish Market Auction Platform</h2>
  <p>
    The Smart Fish Market Auction Platform is a digital system that connects fishermen
    and buyers through real-time online bidding. Fishermen upload their daily catch with
    base prices, and buyers place bids from anywhere. The platform automatically selects
    the highest bidder for each fish lot, ensuring transparent and fair pricing. By reducing
    middlemen and speeding up the selling process, this system helps fishermen earn more
    and allows buyers to access fresh seafood quickly and efficiently.

  <h2>2. Eco-Tourism Route Optimization App</h2>
  <p>
    The Eco-Tourism Route Optimization App helps tourists explore the best attractions
    through smart, personalized route planning. Users select their interests such as
    beaches, waterfalls, temples, or nature trails, and the app calculates the most
    efficient travel path using real-time data. This ensures a smooth and time-saving
    travel experience while promoting sustainable and well-managed tourism.

  <h2>3. Smart Irrigation & Paddy Water Distribution System</h2>
  <p>
    The Smart Irrigation and Paddy Water Distribution system helps farmers manage water
    efficiently using sensor data and intelligent allocation algorithms. It continuously
    monitors soil moisture, weather conditions, and crop growth stages, and automatically
    adjusts irrigation schedules to save water and improve crop productivity.

  <h2>4. Autonomous Beach Cleaning Robots</h2>
  <p>
    Autonomous robots patrol beaches to detect waste using sensors and collect it
    efficiently through smart path-planning algorithms. These robots reduce the need
    for manual labor, maintain cleaner beaches, and support sustainable coastal and
    marine ecosystem management.

  <h2>5. Micro Solar Energy Trading Platform</h2>
  <p>
    The micro solar energy trading platform enables households to buy and sell surplus
    solar power. Smart matching and pricing algorithms efficiently connect buyers and
    sellers, helping reduce energy costs, increase renewable energy usage, and promote
    sustainable energy adoption.

  <h2>8. Water Taxi & Coastal Boat Routing</h2>
  <p>
    The water taxi and coastal boat routing system provides fast and efficient water-based
    transportation across rivers and coastal regions. Smart routing algorithms reduce
    travel time, fuel costs, and improve connectivity while supporting sustainable urban
    transport.
